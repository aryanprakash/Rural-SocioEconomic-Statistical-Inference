# Rural Socio-Economic Determinants & Wealth Proxies: A Statistical Inference Study

## Project Overview
This project performs an inferential statistical analysis on a dataset of **280 rural households** in Maharashtra, India. The study moves beyond descriptive statistics to test fundamental hypotheses regarding the structural drivers of rural wealth, liquidity, and social exclusion. 

By applying **Hypothesis Testing** (t-Tests, ANOVA, Correlation) via **JASP**, the project identifies whether traditional wealth proxies—such as housing type and land ownership—remain statistically significant in an era of high state welfare and non-farm diversification.

## Technical Methodology & Statistical Framework
The analysis utilized **JASP** to execute the following statistical tests:

* **One-Way ANOVA:** Conducted to measure economic parity across social categories (General, OBC, and Scheduled Castes).
* **Independent t-Tests:** Utilized to evaluate the validity of "Housing Type" (Pucca vs. Kuccha) as a proxy for household expenditure.
* **Pearson Correlation:** Performed to determine the degree of decoupling between land ownership and actual liquid consumption.
* **Assumption Testing:** Verified normality and homogeneity of variance (Levene’s Test) to ensure the robustness of the inferential models.



## Strategic Insights & "Myth-Busting"
* **The Housing Proxy Myth:** The study successfully debunked the assumption that a "Pucca" (permanent) house predicts higher household liquidity. The lack of statistical significance suggests that government housing subsidies (PMAY) have normalized housing, making it an unreliable filter for targeted welfare.
* **Structural Caste Exclusion:** ANOVA results confirmed that while OBCs have reached economic parity with the General category, **Scheduled Castes (SC)** remain a statistically distinct economic underclass with significantly lower mean expenditures.
* **Land-Rich, Cash-Poor:** Correlation analysis revealed a weakening link between land size and consumption, indicating a structural shift toward non-farm income for daily liquidity needs.



## Policy Recommendations
1.  **Refine Welfare Filters:** Shift away from "Housing Type" as a primary criterion for BPL (Below Poverty Line) targeting.
2.  **Asset-Backed Liquidity:** Develop financial products (e.g., micro-credit lines) specifically for households that own land but lack daily cash flow.
3.  **Enterprise-Focused SHG Loans:** Prioritize funding for retail and service-based small enterprises over traditional seasonal crop loans to boost village-wide liquidity.
